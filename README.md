# Pre-Work guide

## Description
 Starting off my motivation for the project was the term 'not yet'. I had to understand that with front end development there will always be a learning curve, and at i will never know everything due to the constant development of technology and coding. I did not want to be held down by the 'tyranny of now' as i had done in the past, i saw that even though at this current moment my knowledge is limted there is always time to improve and better myself. I built this project to show to myself that i and anyone else wishing to start a new journey can do it. I had to solve many problems like my JavaScript code not showing up in the console due to a bug, my css not linking to the html, for for loops not working, but the biggest problem was half of my files getting currupted, which you would think would'nt be a bad thing because of linking my work to GitHub but i struggled to do that resulting in having to create a new repository as in the effort in trying to fix it i made it worse. This taught me to always make sure i merge my local branches back to the main branches in GitHub so i dont lose my work. I also learnt the basics of, HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript with the help of the Growth Mindset.
